# Just Portfolio

Welcome to my Just Portfolio repository! Here, I showcase my skills, experience, and coding journey through various projects and works.

## Overview

This repository serves as a platform where I present my skills in JavaScript and web development. It contains a collection of projects and works that highlight my abilities and experience.

## Inspiration

The inspiration for this portfolio came from a wonderful project created by [vinaysomawat](https://github.com/vinaysomawat/vinaysomawat.github.io). Their project served as the foundation for my portfolio, which I customized and adapted to reflect my style, skills, and journey.
